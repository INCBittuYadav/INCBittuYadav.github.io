          <h3>Increase internal transparency of valuable data </h3>
          <p>Many organisations also fail to break down internal data silos, impeding data sharing and collaboration across an organisations 
            business units. According to a study among 1000 business leaders and technology managers it was discovered that 
            <ul>
              <li>45 percent say that data sharing can not happen freely in their organisation.</li>
              <li>91% of the surveys IT respondents say data is split between multiple cloud systems, a mix of cloud and on-premises systems, 
            or only on-premises systems, which impacts ubiquity of access. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Instead of exposing raw data to wide range of internal data consumers which are more and more non-technical business people, data is 
            productized into easy to consume valuable data products. The productized layer of data is the key in increasing the internal 
            transparency of valuable data. </p>

                Machine-readable clearly defined access to data.  
                <ul>
                  <li>ODPS 2.0 contains standardized model to define data access with 9 attributes. </li> 
                
                </ul>

              <p>
                Data democratization is built on top of transparency. That is enabled by decoupling data from systems in order to provide easier and faster data discovery and comparison.
