          <p>Many organisations fail to break down internal data silos, impeding data sharing and collaboration across an organisations 
            business units. According to a <a class="usecases-link" href="https://itbrief.com.au/story/businesses-unable-to-properly-succeed-in-data-economy">study among 1000 business leaders and technology managers</a> it was discovered that 
            <ul class="usecase-list-items">
              <li>45% say that data sharing can not happen freely in their organisation.</li>
              <li>91% of the surveys IT respondents say data is split between multiple cloud systems, a mix of cloud and on-premises systems, 
            or only on-premises systems, which impacts ubiquity of access. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Instead of exposing raw data to wide range of internal data consumers which are more and more non-technical business people, data is 
            productized into easy to consume valuable data products. The productized layer of data is the key in increasing the internal 
            transparency of valuable data. </p>

              <p>
                ODPS is a suitable protocol to break down the silos and internal organizational borders between business units. 
                With the help of ODPS data sharing can be enabled with one transparent metadata model. 
                Included standard business metadata elements express the data's purpose and value proposition. 
                ODPS enables provision of a machine-readable clearly defined access to data. 
                Data democratization is built on top of transparency and that is enabled by decoupling data from systems in order to provide easier and faster data discovery and comparison.

          <p>There is currently a clear trend towards the development of new trading platforms specializing in the commercial exchange of data. 
            Data monetization failures can be attributed to the fact that many customers are not prepared to pay the required price for the data. 
            One main reason is that customers do not recognize the value of the data before purchasing it because it cannot be fully 
            disclosed prior to purchase (known as the ‘Arrow paradox’).
