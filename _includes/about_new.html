                    I am a pasionate mobile developer working in the field for over 3 years now. During my job I worked with multiple
                    mobile frameworks like Xamarin and Native iOS/Android. In the last year I started working with Flutter and Django
                    creating my own application with 2 launched whitelabels.

                      Out of office I am a <b> rock climber</b>. It's been 2 years since I fell in love with this sport.
                      My hardes climb was a lead route called <b> "Let's go back"</b>, graded <b>7c+</b>
                      for difficulty (it's very hard). When I'm not climbing or working on the job I like to play with personal project
                      and further develop my skills.
