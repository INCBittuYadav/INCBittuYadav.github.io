My grandmother's brain is rotting.  She has Alzheimer's disease.  This is a biological problem that will be solved sooner or later.  Sooner, if we spend money on research to fully understand the mechanisms and experiment with potenential solutions.  Later, if we instead spend that money on other stuff. 

The sector that gets the most of our resources is the financial sector.  Its share of the economy totals $2 trillion dollars.  In the 1960s, finance and insurance accounted for only 4% of GDP, whereas in 2007 finance and insurance accounted for 8% of GDP.
