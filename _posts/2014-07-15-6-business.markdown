description: I helped to double annual sales revenue at St. Louis Testing Laboratories
  as the Director of Chemical Testing by implementing a large scale Google Adwords
  campaign consisting of hundreds of ads, keywords, and negative keywords for a wide
  array of testing services offered.  I also saved the company thousands of man hours
  by automating many formerly manual processes by building a laboratory information
  management system.
