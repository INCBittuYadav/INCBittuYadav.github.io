description: I moved to Margao around 6 years ago, and have enjoyed being a part of the vibrant Carmelite community. I am invested in baking, music and the welfare of animals, especially since my two dogs are rescued strays. I joined the Carmel Youth in order to be a part of the amazing work that it does, to ground myself in the Catholic faith, and to be a part of a group that works together for the betterment of society. As a member of the Youth, I hope to leverage my skills and talents to contribute to society, especially the elderly and the underprivileged, while learning from like-minded Youth members, under the mentorship of our Carmelite Priests.
