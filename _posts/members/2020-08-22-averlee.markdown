description: Hey, my name is Averlee Vaz, amd I'm from Navelim. My hobbies range from reading, music, dancing trekking, travelling gaming and sleeping. I am a BCom graduate in Honors of Business management and I am carrying on my dad's construction business. I'm a part of Carmel Youth ecause it has taught me alot in these years - discipline, dedication and humbleness! The like the fact that the youth encourages spending quality time in prayer. It's the only place where we can be calm. I also enjoy reading in church and participating in the choir. I would love to help in whatever way I can make myself useful to the Carmel Youth.
