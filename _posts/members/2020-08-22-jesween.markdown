description: Hey, my name is Jesween Shinde and I hail all the way from Navelim. My hobbies range from travelling, music, reading sleeping, tech-tinkering,and ethical hacking. I am a student pursuing my engieering degree in Computers and I work professionally as a DJ and music producer. I am part of the Carmel Youth because it has taught me a lot in these years and I've learnt to discipline a few of my habits. The fact that I like (of the youth) is the bonding with prayer as it's the only place we can slow down in our fast paced lives. I would really lovve to help in whichever way I can to make muself push the youth to being better.
