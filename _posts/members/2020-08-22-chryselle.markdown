description: Hey, my name is Chryselle and I'm 19 years old. I was born and brought up in Goa and I'm currently doing my second year BSc. In my free I love to listen to music, play video games and exploring and learn interesting new ideas. I hvae joined the Carmel youth so I could helpl sperad thappiness to everyone. Joining the youth has brought me closer to God and helped me develop a deeper love for Him. What I like most about the youth is the unity and positivity that everboody has. As a youth member, I would like to help the other youth turn towards God and believe in Him.
