description: I'm Keenan Cardozo, I'm from Varca and am currently pursuing my 3rd year in Mechanical Engineering at Don Bosco College of Engineering, Fatorda. I'm a "keen" enthusiast for sports like Taekwondo, Football and Table Tennis among others. I love to travel and visit new places with family and friends. After listening to many interesting stories about the Carmel Youth from my friends (Benecia and Karen) I wwas motivated to join. People in the Carmel youth are friendly, supportive, dedicated and caring. The activities organised and the work done here is really interesting - it keeps me engaged and I never get bored. As a member I would always love to help the community in whatever way I can and encourage more youth to join the Lights and be closer to God.
