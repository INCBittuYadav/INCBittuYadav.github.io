description: Hi, I'm Julius Alphonso! I'm usually the pianist who accompanies the youth choir. I joined the youth in 2017, soon after 12th std. I frequent mass and the monastery, enjoyed the youth's choir and wanted to be a part of it. I've found this group to be a very safe space. Where people can grown without being ridiculed, where friendships are forged wihout any opportunism, where charitable work is done without expecting to be repaid. Despite the organisational heirarchy that creeps into any such group. The Carmel Lights have stayed true to what they are - a group young adults, friends, growing together in faith with Christ at the center.
