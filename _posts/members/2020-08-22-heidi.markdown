description: I'm a simple, yet well know personality at the Carmelite Monastery. I live in the peaceful village of Davorlim and study Biotechnology at Smt. Parvatibai Chowgule College. I joined the Carmel Lights in 2018 and ever since, it has been a wonderful experience. Love for the poor and animals are of the highest priority. I'm really fond of nature and am always up for a picnic,outing or any youth event. I am a God fearing, joyful and a positive person.
