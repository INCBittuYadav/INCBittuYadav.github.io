description: Hi I'm Leif! I live in Navelim, and I love to travel and all sorts of sports. I joined the Carmel Youth because of the amazing people in the group. Everyone here has an open mindset, and the priest are on a whole new level. I don't know how the manage to stay so jolly with all the responsibility they have on their shoulders. The Youth is a very active place. Despite us being in lockdown, I still see a health participation among everyone! I believe in actions over words, and being a Light helps me set peoples' hearts ablaze.
