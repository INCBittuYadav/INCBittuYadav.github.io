description: On 14 October, we had an interesting talk on Demonology by Fr. Noel. Ile touched on topics like ghosts, demons, spirits, demonic possessions, and paranormal activities. It was an interesting talk and also a great learning experience. More than that, it helped us grow in faith in the power and goodness of God.
