description: One of our most memorable trips was the visit to the AIDS home for children in Cavelossim. We visited the children there and spent some time interacting with them. The kids were so enthusiastic, they even taught us some interesting tips and tricks. Towards the end they performed a 'Thank You' song for us. It was definitely a well spent day!
