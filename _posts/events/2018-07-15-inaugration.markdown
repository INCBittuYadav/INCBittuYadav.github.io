description: 15 July 2018, marked the beginning of yet another fun filled year for the Carmel Youth. With the liturgical theme - "Do something beautiful for God" this joyful occasion marked the leadership of the newly appointed animators - Mr. Julius Alphonso (President), Ms. Swizel Pereira (Vice President), Ms. Benecia Colaco (Choir Master) and Ms. Melanie Kevin (Liturgical Animator). It was a day of rejoicing at the entry of new members, as much as we sadly bid farewell to the outgoing ones.
