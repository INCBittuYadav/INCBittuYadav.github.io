description: As young adults, the morality of the Church as regards to relationships is a topic that raises a lot of misunderstanding. This rather vast and confusing topic was well explained to us by Fr. Noel, clearing a lot of our doubts and answering several questions including that of the physicality of relationships, sanctity of marriage, and love. It was an eye-opening and heart-touching experience.
