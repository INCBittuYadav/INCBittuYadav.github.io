description: December 2018 was one busy, month with our annual Advent Sale, held to raise money for the underprivileged children and also help the poor. We had an array of beautiful stars up for sale, and the last Advent Sunday, an amazing sale of brownies, and other mouth-watering goodies. The remaining Christmas treats were distributed among the kids at various orphanages, and at the old age homes.
