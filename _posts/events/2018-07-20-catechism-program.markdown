description: It definitely was a fun filled and eventful experience engaging the catechism students from classes 6 to 9. The older kids were given talls on social media and the do's and don'ts of it. While the younger kids had their share of fun playing several games including charades, crossword puzzles, Pictionary, etc. and went home with smiles on their faces.
