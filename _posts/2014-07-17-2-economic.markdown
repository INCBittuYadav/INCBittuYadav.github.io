description: I created Think by Numbers where I use statistical analysis and entertaining
  infographics to explore how data can be used to minimize global suffering. <br><br>  With
  over 2 million visitors, I hope I'm making a little bit of progress towards a world
  where public policy is optimized using statistical analysis instead of tribal gut
  instinct.
